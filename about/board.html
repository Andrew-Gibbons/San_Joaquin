      <h1>Board of Directors</h1>
      <p>The San Joaquin Valley Paleontologist Club is guided by a dedicated Board of Directors 
         whose combined 35 years of service have shaped the organization into a thriving hub 
         for scientific discovery and community engagement. Their leadership ensures that the 
         Club remains true to its mission of exploring, preserving, and sharing the fossil record.</p>

      <p>Our board is composed of educators, researchers, and community leaders who bring 
         diverse expertise to the table. Some members have backgrounds in vertebrate paleontology, 
         while others specialize in paleoecology, museum curation, or science education. Together, 
         they provide a balanced perspective that strengthens both our academic programming and 
         our outreach efforts.</p>

      <p>Over the past three and a half decades, the Board has overseen countless initiatives: 
         organizing annual lecture series, coordinating field trips to fossil sites, and 
         developing partnerships with universities and museums. Their collective experience 
         has allowed the Club to adapt to changing times while maintaining a strong commitment 
         to scientific integrity and public education.</p>

      <p>Board members have also played a crucial role in mentoring the next generation of 
         paleontologists. Through student symposia, internships, and volunteer opportunities, 
         they have opened doors for young scientists eager to learn the craft of excavation, 
         analysis, and storytelling. Their guidance has helped cultivate a vibrant community 
         of learners who carry forward the Club’s legacy.</p>

      <p>As we celebrate 75 years of the Club’s history, we honor the Board of Directors for 
         their steadfast leadership. Their combined 35 years of service reflect not only 
         dedication to paleontology but also a deep commitment to the San Joaquin Valley 
         community. With their vision and experience, the Club continues to thrive as a place 
         where science and curiosity meet.</p>
