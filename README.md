This is a Murach's project. The Murach reference and training material only showed how to put each page up individually, not to have all the pages navigable from the navbar. This site is what I was able to get into production without looking at any of the solutions.

On this version all pages should be navigable through the navbar but only for mobile. I am unable to get the navbar to work at the same time for both desktop and mobile.

I also notice what seems to be a margin issue at the bottom of each menu item where there is a slight white line below each one. Troubleshooting this issue did not resolve it.

Lastly, the menu for speakers has Andrew Ross Sorkin extending beyond the white highlighted box when hovered over. A fix could either be to make the menu wider, which may look funny with the blank space after the shorter names, or have his name on two lines.

I would appreciate a mentor who help me close these gaps in my skill. I think it would be great to spend time learning more advanced technical concepts.
