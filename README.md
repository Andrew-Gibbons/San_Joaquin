This is a Murach's project.  The Murach reference and training material only showed how to put each page up individually, not to have all the pages navigable from the navbar.

On this version all pages should be navigable through the navbar but only for mobile.  I am unable to get the navbar to work at the same time for both desktop and mobile.

I would appreciate a mentor who can see that I just need more training and is willing to assist me in getting over the last challenge.
