    		<h2>April<br>Andrew Sorkin</h2>
    		<p>What can fossilized bones and ancient ecosystems tell us about the history of life on Earth? 
       			According to junior paleontologist Andrew Sorkin, even the smallest discoveries can reveal 
       			extraordinary stories of adaptation and survival. Join us at the Saroyan when Sorkin—an emerging 
       			voice in the field—shares how early fieldwork experiences are shaping his understanding of 
       			prehistoric worlds and their connections to our present environment.</p>
    		<p>Andrew Sorkin is a junior paleontologist whose research bridges excavation practice with evolutionary 
       			interpretation. Born and raised with a fascination for natural history, he studied biology and earth 
       			sciences before beginning hands-on fossil fieldwork. His early projects have focused on vertebrate 
       			remains in North America, examining how skeletal structures reflect climate shifts, migration, and 
       			ecological change.</p>
    		<p>As part of collaborative research teams, Sorkin has participated in digs across the western United 
       			States and Europe, contributing to studies of dinosaur morphology, ancient ecosystems, and extinction 
       			patterns. His interests include the paleontology of identity within species, the role of environment 
       			in shaping evolutionary pathways, and the ways in which small-scale fossil finds contribute to broader 
       			narratives of life’s history.</p>
    		<p>Sorkin is currently developing his first set of published papers, highlighting lessons learned from 
       			fieldwork and the importance of mentorship in paleontology. He has presented at student symposia and 
       			community forums, where his enthusiasm for connecting past and present continues to inspire audiences. 
       			As he advances in his career, Sorkin’s work promises to shed light on how paleontology helps us 
       			understand not only ancient species but also the resilience of life itself.</p>
